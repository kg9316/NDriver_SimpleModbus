# NDriver_SimpleModbus

### Niagara Ndriver example

There are no practical examples out there on Ndriver.

Tridium have Sphero and Midi example at their GitHub page https://github.com/tridium

This is an example that we all can relate to

The goal in this repo is to make minimal ModbusTCP client.

ModbusTCP uses TransactionID this repo will shop how to deal with that.

There will be other repos that have ModbusRTU and one that combine the two in the same network.

ModbusRTU introduces CRC calculation.

Testing can be done with a ModbusTcpSlaveNetwork on the same station.

For more advanced testing where you can manipulate transactionID's and exception codes I use https://www.helmholz.cz/download/category/3-software?download=26:ananas 

`You will have to modify the environment.gradle file for your needs.`
